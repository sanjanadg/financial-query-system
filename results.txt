**AI Analysis**

**Response to Query on MXD's Indirect Costs**

To determine the percentage of MXD's costs that are classified as indirect, we need to analyze the financial data available for the relevant months. 

### Indirect Costs Percentage
The percentage of indirect costs is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Indirect Cost Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Indirect Costs}}{\text{Total Costs}} \right) \times 100 \]

Unfortunately, the specific values for indirect costs and total costs for each month were not provided in the data retrieved. Therefore, I recommend reviewing the financial statements, particularly the "Branch P&L" and "HEC Financials" sheets, to extract the necessary figures for a precise calculation.

### Month with Highest Indirect Cost Percentage
To identify the month with the highest percentage of indirect costs, you would typically compare the calculated percentages across all months from January 2022 to October 2023. Again, without specific data points, I cannot provide the exact month with the highest percentage.

### Recommendations
1. **Data Extraction**: Please extract the total costs and indirect costs from the "Branch P&L" and "HEC Financials" sheets for each month.
2. **Calculation**: Use the formula provided to calculate the indirect cost percentage for each month.
3. **Comparison**: Identify the month with the highest percentage based on your calculations.

If you can provide the specific figures for indirect and total costs, I would be happy to assist you further in calculating the exact percentages and identifying the month with the highest indirect costs.

**Subject: Advertising Forecasts for Branch in 2024**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for your inquiry regarding Branch's advertising forecasts for each month in 2024. 

Currently, specific monthly advertising forecasts for Branch in 2024 are not directly available in the data provided. However, I can guide you on how to interpret the financial data and what to consider for forecasting.

### Key Considerations for Advertising Forecasts:
1. **Historical Trends**: Analyzing past advertising expenditures and their correlation with revenue growth can provide insights into future spending. For instance, if advertising spend has historically increased in line with revenue growth, this trend may continue.

2. **Market Conditions**: Consider external factors such as market demand, competition, and economic conditions that could impact advertising budgets.

3. **Strategic Initiatives**: Any planned marketing campaigns or product launches in 2024 should be factored into the advertising budget. 

4. **Budget Allocation**: Review the overall budget for 2024, which may include allocations for digital marketing, traditional media, and promotional events.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Time Series Analysis**: Utilize historical data to perform a time series analysis, which can help in predicting future advertising expenditures based on past trends.
- **Consult Internal Projections**: If available, refer to Branch's internal financial planning documents or consult with the marketing department for their projections.

### Next Steps:
If you require specific figures or a detailed breakdown of the advertising budget for each month, I recommend reaching out to Branch's finance or marketing teams directly, as they may have access to more granular forecasts or insights.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or specific analyses.
